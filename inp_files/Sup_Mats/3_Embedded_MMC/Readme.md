This folder is built for the article _A novel explicit design method for complex thin-walled structures based on embedded solid moving morphable components_.

Three sub-folders here consist of inp-format files containing geometry models (described by triangular meshes) of numerical examples from the abovementioned article. The prefix of the name of each folder corresponds to the numerical example of the same sequence, respectively.

Since the practical models utilized to compute are solid models generated from the surface model (i.e., the shell model), this library provides both surface and solid geometry models.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or ideas. My email is huowd@mail.dlut.edu.cn.
