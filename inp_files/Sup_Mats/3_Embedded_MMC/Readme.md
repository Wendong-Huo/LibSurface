This folder is built for the article _A novel explicit design method for complex thin-walled structures based on embedded solid moving morphable components_.

Three sub-folders here consists of inp-format files, which contain geometry models (described by triangular meshes) of numerical examples from the abovementioned article. The prefix of the name of each folder corresponds to the numerical example of the same sequence number.

Due to that the practical model utilized to compute is the solid model, which is generated from the surface (i.e., the shell model), this library shares not only the surface but also solid geometry models.

Please feel free to contact me if you have further requests or ideas. My email is huowd@mail.dlut.edu.cn.
