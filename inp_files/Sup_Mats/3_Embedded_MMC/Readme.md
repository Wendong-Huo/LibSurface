This file is built for the article _A novel explicit design method for complex thin-walled structures based on embedded solid moving morphable components_.

Three documents of inp-type file here contain geometry models (described by triangular meshes) of numerical examples from the abovementioned article. The prefix in the name of each file corresponds to the example of the same sequence number.

Please feel free to contact me if you have further requests or ideas. My email is huowd@mail.dlut.edu.cn.
